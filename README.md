# 📈 Stocks-Project

This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques from the fields of **Clustering** and **Time Series Analysis** to analyze stock price fluctuations and predict future trends.

## 🚀 Overview
- 🏷 **Clustering Algorithms** – Used to classify different time periods and stock price movements based on historical data.
- 🔮 **Time Series Forecasting** – Implemented to predict future price changes and trends.

## 📊 Methodologies
### **1️⃣ Clustering for Market Segmentation**
- Applied clustering techniques to group stock price movements into distinct patterns.
- Identified trends and volatility periods based on historical market data.

### **2️⃣ Time Series Forecasting**
- Utilized advanced time series models to predict future price changes.
- Techniques such as **Prophet**, **ARIMA**, and **LSTM** were considered for trend analysis.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for clustering algorithms
- **Facebook Prophet** / **ARIMA** for time series forecasting
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
